# FarmConnect
FarmConnect is a farmer-to-market supply chain platform I developed to help farmers connect directly with buyers. It enables produce listings, order tracking, and fair pricing by reducing middlemen. Built with Java and MySQL, it streamlines transactions and supports efficient farm-to-market distribution.
